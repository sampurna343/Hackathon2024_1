Data Preprocessing steps:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Check for null values.
	-> remove the row or impute value in case of NULL occurences

2. Co-related feature check
	-> when two features are related to each other
	-> ex: height provided in CM in one column and FEET in another column
	-> df.corr() gives correlation in form of numbers
	-> remove one of the features

3. Data Molding
	-> ecncoding text/image to number
	-> using a map, use dataframe to transform the data

4. Data Spliting
	-> split the data into train set and test set using test_train_split
	-> use random=42

5. Data Impute:
	-> replace the null value with other values ex. mean value
	-> from sklern.Impute import SimpleImputer
	-> do a fit_transform()

6. Feature Scaling or Data Standarization
	-> standarise the data into a specific range to see each column as same priority
	-> if some column (ex. salary) has higher range of values, ML algos will think those feature as strong.
	-> from sklearn import preprocessing
	-> preprocessing.scale(column_name)

7. Label Encoding
	-> text to number conversion
	-> if only two texts are present, make them 0 and 1
	-> fit_transform using a library label texts as number

8. One Hot Coding
	-> text to number conversion	
	-> for example: a column is having 5 types of text values
	   it creates 5 columns and assign 0/1 to each row.
           if values are male/female/trans, then there will be three columns
	   as gender_male, gender_female, gender_trans and put gender_male as 1
	   for males and keep other columns 0.
